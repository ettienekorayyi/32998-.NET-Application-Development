# 32998-.NET-Application-Development
These assessment showcase my competency .NET/C#. This projects demonstrated  file manipulation techniques and good OOP design thru the implementation of loosely coupled classes and utilising design principles such as Single Responsibility and Composite Reuse Principle to achieve polymorphic behavior by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality. I've also utilized the factory pattern to delegate the creation of the file dialog and save file dialog to the factory dialog. I also used singleton design pattern to restrict the instantiation of a class to only one object .
